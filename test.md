Below is an example **Configuration** section you can include in your README. It provides an overview of each `config.py` file across the different modules (`data_extraction`, `data_processing`, `index_creation`), their purpose, and how to customize them for your environment.

## Configuration

This application uses separate configuration files in each module to simplify and centralize environment-specific settings. Below are the main `config.py` files and what they control.

### 1. `data_extraction/config.py`
**Location:** `data_extraction/config.py`

**Purpose:**
- Defines the **base output directory** for extracted JSONL files.
- Stores configuration details for each **TM1 cube** you plan to extract data from, including:
  - A custom subfolder for each cube’s extracted data.
  - The list of **dimensions** that should be extracted.

**Key Variables:**
- `BASE_OUTPUT_DIR`: The top-level directory where extracted JSONL files will be written.  
- `CUBE_CONFIG`: A dictionary mapping cube names (e.g., `"Management Reporting"`) to their respective sub-directories and dimensions.

**Usage Tips:**
- Add new cubes to `CUBE_CONFIG` if you need to extract data from multiple cubes.
- Each entry in `CUBE_CONFIG` should specify:
  - An output directory (`"output_dir"`) inside `BASE_OUTPUT_DIR`.
  - A list of dimension names (`"dimensions"`) that you want to process for that cube.


### 2. `data_processing/config.py`
**Location:** `data_processing/config.py`

**Purpose:**
- Points to the **location** where the extracted JSONL files from `data_extraction` are stored.
- Specifies **which files** to process, along with keys used to extract meaningful data from the JSON records.

**Key Variables:**
- `BASE_DIRECTORY`: Typically references the folder holding all extracted JSONL files (e.g., `../data_extraction/extracted_values/`).
- `CONFIG`: A dictionary for each **business area** (e.g., `"Management Reporting"`), defining:
  - `directory` (or `sub_directory`) where the JSONL files reside relative to `BASE_DIRECTORY`.
  - `jsonl_files`: The list of specific JSONL filenames to load.
  - `dimension_key` and `value_keys`: The names of the JSON fields that should be used to build the DataFrame (e.g., `"element_name"`, `"attribute_value"`).

**Usage Tips:**
- Ensure `directory` (or `sub_directory`) and the filenames match the actual paths/files generated by `data_extraction`.
- If you add a new “area” or domain for processing, create a new entry in the `CONFIG` dictionary with its own directory and file list.


### 3. `index_creation/config.py`
**Location:** `index_creation/config.py`

**Purpose:**
- Controls **where** the final FAISS index files are stored.
- Points to the **model location** for the `SentenceTransformer` used to generate embeddings.
- Organizes configurations for each area’s index creation details.

**Key Variables:**
- `CONFIG["areas"]`: A dictionary mapping each business area (e.g., `"Management Reporting"`) to its FAISS index output path.
- `CONFIG["model_location"]`: Determines where the `SentenceTransformer` model is loaded from.
  - Defaults to a specific path on the file system.
  - Can switch to a container-friendly path if the environment variable `IS_CONTAINER` is set to `"Docker"`.

**Usage Tips:**
- If you run this code in a **Docker container**, ensure `IS_CONTAINER="Docker"` is set, and that `HOME` is defined (for the model path). Otherwise, the default local path is used.
- Add a new entry to `CONFIG["areas"]` if you need separate FAISS indices for different data domains or business areas.
- Make sure the `output_index_path` points to a valid folder (the default is `index_creation/indices/`).


### Environment Variables
- **`IS_CONTAINER`**: Used in `index_creation/config.py` to switch the `model_location` between a containerized path and a local path.  
- **`HOME`**: Referenced if `IS_CONTAINER="Docker"`, to construct the full path to the model.

By adjusting these config files appropriately, you can:
- **Add/Remove** cubes or dimensions for extraction (`data_extraction/config.py`).  
- **Re-target** or rename JSONL files to process (`data_processing/config.py`).  
- **Change or extend** the areas for which FAISS indices are created (`index_creation/config.py`).  
- **Override** paths for local vs. containerized runs (e.g., setting `IS_CONTAINER`).

Make sure to review each config file before running the corresponding scripts (`extract_values.py`, `process_jsonl.py`, `create_index.py`) to ensure paths match your environment and data requirements.
